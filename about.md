## What is this site for?

This site contains the literature notes of English and Bengali according to the syllabus of ISC 2017. These notes are provided to us from our school - [Vivekananda Mission School, Joka](http://www.vmskolkata.org/). The purpose of this site is to provide easy access to the notes to the students which may help save precious time.

Currently, this site is under development and notes are being organised. Soon, they will be published here and made availabe in an easy-to-read format. Printable PDFs will also be provided.
